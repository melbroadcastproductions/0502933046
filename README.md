### Key Features

- Multiple chart/panel types:
    - **Heatmap (Historical DOM):** Uses live trades and L2 orderbook to create a time-series heatmap chart. Supports customizable price grouping, different time aggregations, fixed or visible range volume profile.
    - **Candlestick:** Traditional kline chart supporting both time-based and custom tick-based intervals.
    - **Footprint:** Price grouped and interval aggregated views for trades on top of a candlestick chart. Supports different clustering methods, configurable imbalance and naked-POC studies.
    - **Time & Sales:** Scrollable list of live trades.
    - **DOM (Depth of Market) / Ladder:** Displays current L2 orderbook alongside recent trade volumes on grouped price levels.
    - **Comparison:** Line graph for comparing multiple data sources, normalized by kline `close` prices on a percentage scale
- Real-time sound effects driven by trade streams
- Multi window/monitor support
- Pane linking for quickly switching tickers across multiple panes
- Persistent layouts and customizable themes with editable color palettes

#### Historical Trades on Footprint Charts:

By default, Flowsurface captures and plots live trades in real time via WebSocket.

To backfill the visible time range on footprint charts, enable **trade fetching**
in Settings → Network. Three modes are available:

- **Exchange**: Fetches directly from Binance's public REST API and bulk data
  mirrors ([data.binance.vision](https://data.binance.vision/)). Fast for
  daily archives; paginated and rate-limited for intraday ranges. **Binance
  only** (spot, linear, inverse).

- **[Server](https://github.com/flowsurface-rs/server)**: Fetches from any HTTP server that exposes a
  `GET /trades.arrow` endpoint returning an
  [Arrow IPC](https://arrow.apache.org/) stream with:
    - Response: `Content-Type: application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`
    - Schema (columns matched by name, order not significant):

        `ts (int64)`, `price (float64)`, `qty (float64)`, `is_sell (bool)`

    - Query parameters:
      `venue`, `market`, `symbol`, `from` (inclusive), `to` (inclusive), `limit`
    - Optional bearer-token auth: (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

    Self-signed TLS certificates are
    accepted. Works with **all exchanges** and has no exchange rate limits.
    Bring your own data source.

    A reference implementation is available at
    [flowsurface-server](https://github.com/flowsurface-rs/server), a
    self-contained collector that writes trades to DuckDB and serves
    them over this protocol.

- **Off**: Live trades only; no historical backfill.

##### Historical klines, open interest, and ticker metadata/stats are always fetched from exchange REST APIs.

##### Live trades, orderbook and kline updates are streamed from exchange WebSocket feeds.
